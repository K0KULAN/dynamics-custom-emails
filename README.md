# **Welcome to the Dynamics Custom Emails Project!** 

**Dynamics Custom Email** is an extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (CRM) which gives you the _**ability to send emails from a process (e.g. workflow, action) based on an Email Template with dynamic fields**_ (yes, unfortunately that is not an out-of-the-box feature yet!).

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/rtebar/dynamics-custom-emails/wiki) section for more details and documention.

**Note:** this project started initially in Codeplex, see https://crmcustomemails.codeplex.com
